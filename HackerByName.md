Review


INTEREST OF CONTENT - rating: Sound

Good articles, although I think the majority has been copied and pasted since you did provide helpful links to the sources!

CONSISTENCY AND QUALITY OF VISUAL PRESENTATION - rating: Good

Had a consistent theme throughout the site. The theme itself was fairly plain but it has been adhered to in all the articles and main pages. Could have used some more pictures to increase visual interest.

QUALITY OF WRITTEN PRESENTATION - rating: Very Good

Again, the majority of written content is copied from elsewhere, however the information was well laid out and formatted. 

VALIDITY OF HTML - rating: Excellent

All the HTML that is here is good, no obvious errors. Every main page missed the html tags, but that's the only thing I could find!

EVIDENCE OF COLLABORATION - rating: Sound

The author info for each person was written by themself, and one is missing entirely. It wasn't done at the last minute, although the contributions are not balanced - one group member has fewer additions than the reviewers!
