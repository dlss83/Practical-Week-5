            This website was created for a 
            <a href="https://github.com/stevenaeola/proglabs_js/tree/master/formative_1">group coursework.</a>
        </h>
        <p>
            We were tasked with creating a website as a group and to do this we had to collaborate using git. For most of us this was our first time using git and so there was a learning curve, but we managed to overcome it and produce this website.
            We hope you enjoy reading our articles :)
